## iPhone Photography School | Frontend Test

### Installation

- Install php/laravel packages using composer.
- Install js/node packages using npm

### Setup
- Build the project using `npm run dev` command

### Few things to note

1. All the frontend files are present in `resources` directory.


2. I used single file components (`.vue` files) to build the UI.


3. I used sass mixins to implement BEM naming convention following this guide from css-tricks https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/bem-mixins/
